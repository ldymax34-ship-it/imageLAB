 *  - `index` — WHO: stable slot identity from birth; no node rewrites it.

 * Beyond the built-ins, `channels` holds extra named signals authored by
 * Weight nodes — each channel is named after its Weight's source (noise,

 * slots: scale bound to `image luma`, rotation to `noise`. Consumers read
