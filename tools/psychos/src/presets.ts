// The list is deliberately short: one graph per thing the tool is for. Multi
// layer is the first-run factory document — the worked example of the whole
// pipeline. Image grid collage is the other end: one layer, six nodes, the
// Slice → Shuffle → Place loop that cuts a picture up and puts it back down
// wrong on purpose.

// Presets are sparse by design: params left out cook at their def's default
// (the evaluator fills them in), so only the numbers that carry the look are
// written down here.

/**
 * Image grid collage: one Grid feeds both sides of the cut. Slice windows the
 * picture along its cells, Shuffle permutes those same cells among the cells
 * congruent to them (on a uniform grid, all of them), and Place's by-index
 * join lands tile k on slot k's new home. Because tiles and slots come from
 * one layout, every tile is exactly the size of the hole it drops into.
